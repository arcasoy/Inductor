# The Inductor
- Induction charging keyboard (never plug it in to charge again!)
- My induction into PCB design and firmware

## Features
- Split Keyboard
- Ergo & Ortholinear layout
- Induction charging
- Bluetooth communication

## Components:
- Seeeduino Xiao BLE MCU
- MCP I/O Expander
- Kailh Choc Switches
- USB-C Header

## Done:
- Charging circuitry design and validation
- Switch Selection: [Kailh Choc Red](http://www.kailh.com/en/Products/Ks/CS/321.html)
- [Layout](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/e3e7028cc00f300e55809f2b5b43f849)
- Small Scale (4 key) PCB design to validate hardware compatibility
