# The Inductor
- Induction charging keyboard (never plug it in to charge again!)
- My induction into PCB design and firmware

## Features
- Split Keyboard
- Ergo & Ortholinear layout
- Induction charging
- Bluetooth communication

## Components:
- Seeeduino Xiao BLE MCU
- MCP I/O Expander
- Kailh Choc Switches
- USB-C Header

## Done:
